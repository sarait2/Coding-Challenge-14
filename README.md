# Coding-Challenge-14
Creating a Customer Support Ticket System that displays support tickets for a business. Using async/await to handle asynchronous operations, applying try/catch/finally for error handling, and using throw to trigger custom errors. The goal is to simulate how a customer support page retrieves and displays ticket data from an API, with proper error management.
